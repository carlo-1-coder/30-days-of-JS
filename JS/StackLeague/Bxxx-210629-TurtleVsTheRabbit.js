// BRONZE xxx: Turtle Vs The Rabbit; 

// Turtle Vs The Rabbit
// The turtle and the rabbit named A and B respectively must run a race. A starts with an average speed of 720 feet per hour. Young B knows she runs faster than A, and furthermore has not finished her cabbage.
// When she starts, at last, she can see that A has a 70 feet lead but B's speed is 850 feet per hour. How long will it take B to catch A?
// More generally: given two speeds v1 (A's speed, integer > 0) and v2 (B's speed, integer > 0) and a lead g (integer > 0) how long will it take B to catch A?
// The result will be an array [hour, min, sec] which is the time needed in hours, minutes and seconds (round down to the nearest second) or a string in some languages.
// If v1 >= v2 then return nil, nothing, null, None
// Examples:
// race(720, 850, 70) => [0, 32, 18] or "0 32 18"
// race(80, 91, 37) => [3, 21, 49] or "3 21 49"
